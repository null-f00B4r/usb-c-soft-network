TODO: Add riddle here.

Footnotes: 
¹ Official Galactic Registry designation as of Stardate 47634.44. Subject to change without notice.
    - Planetary designation subject to change every 3.7 galactic standard minutes due to that annoying spinning thing it does. 
    - Recommended approach vector: 
        + Just aim vaguely sunward and hope for the best. 
    - Warning: 
        + Inhabitants may attempt communication via primitive radio waves and/or thermonuclear explosions. 
        + Bring towel.
² The filing clerk at the Galactic Nomenclature Office would have undoubtedly added a stamp reading "PENDING REVIEW - FORM 27B/6 NOT SUBMITTED" and then gone for lunch, leaving the name in perpetual bureaucratic limbo, which is rather appropriate given that nobody who lives there can agree on what to call most things anyway.
